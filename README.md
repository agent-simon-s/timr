##What is it?
A lap timer to help me time my PT reps, so I can focus on the exercises and not the counting. 
Interface is also designed so once it's configured, you can operate it with repeatedly clicking one button, requiring little attention.

##How is it made?
Written in HTM5, CSS3, and JS 
JS is palne no libraries or frameworks, save modeneriser for manageing back compatability with CSS3  & webfonts
Primarily an exercise for myself to make a GUI with no images, using webfonts. 
Also using HTML5 style crossplatform audio for timer chime.

##Trivia
The beeps and chimes are my girlfriend captured on a digital recorder 

##Improvments
at some point i want to add a settings drop dowen menue with choices for
toggling audio  chimes
toggling visial chime
seconds / miniutes / default time
possibly some themes
